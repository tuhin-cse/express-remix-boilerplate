# Express-Remix Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate setup for developing a fully functional web application using Express as the backend and Remix as the frontend, supporting both SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and CSR (Client-Side Rendering) on the same port. This setup allows developers to build, run, and deploy applications efficiently, with Remix handling the front-end rendering and Express serving as the API layer.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **`app`**: Contains the Remix app. Here, developers can build a fully functional Remix application with SSR and CSR capabilities.
- **`server`**: Contains the Express API backend, including API routes, controllers, middlewares, and utilities.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Development Mode

To start the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building the Application

To build the Remix and Express applications:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Production Mode

To start the application in production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```
